boilermake
==========

This is my code for our Boilermake 2014 project, "Manos", details of which can be found here: http://challengepost.com/software/manos

Currenty this repo only contains the code to actuate the hand, as the EMG collection and processing was worked on by Cody.

Additionally, this repo contains the firmware that I wrote to control the hand from my Boilermake badge.

This will get expanded as I add in more bits that I helped out with from various other projects.


Here are some videos of the final project:
